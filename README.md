#Neural Networks Demystified

Supporting iPython notebooks for the YouTube Series Neural Networks Demystified. I've included formulas, code, and the text of the movies in the iPython notebooks, in addition to raw code in python scripts. 

iPython notebooks can be downloaded and run locally, or viewed using nbviewer: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/. 

##Using the iPython notebook
The iPython notebook is an incredible tool, but can be a little tricky to setup. I recommend the [anaconda] (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) distribution of python. Also, the notebooks here assume you've launched the notebook with the pylab option: 

ipython noteobook --pylab inline
